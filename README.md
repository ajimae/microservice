### Technical Specification
To get detailed information about the project. Read the [technical spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/165WerV4NgNd5V-3v_1SvHVic0uSgg3e2wILGMOaMkRs/edit?usp=sharing)

### Setup Instructions

First create a file with name `.env` in each of the service directory `users`, `comments` and `auth`

#### Production deploy

It's very important to note that the application can run in development and production mode. In production mode, the database config is set to use a local mongodb installation, while the production is set to use an atlas mongodb connection url.

- Make sure you have docker installed.
- Clone this repository.
- `cd` into the repository
- Run `docker-compose up`
- Access the app webpage on `http://localhost:8080` :zap:

#### Local deployment

- Spin up a mongodb local instance on your development machine and ensure it's listening on the default mongodb port (27017).
- Clone this repository
- Pull up a terminal `cd` into the respective service `users`, `comments` and `auth`
- In each of the service run `yarn install` or `npm install` to install dependencies
- Then still within the service terminal window, run `yarn start:dev` or `npm run start:dev`
- Each of the services should spin up and start listening for incoming requests.
